##ANN Prediction Project
This project utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to perform predictive analytics. The model is designed to analyze data, identify patterns, and make accurate predictions for a given problem domain.

##Features
Implementation of a fully connected ANN.
Supports customizable architectures with multiple layers and activation functions.
Includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation scripts.
Visualizations for training performance and prediction outcomes.
##Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras (or the framework you used)
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
##Applications
Predictive modeling for datasets in fields like finance, healthcare, and more.
##How to Use
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
Run the preprocessing script to prepare your dataset.
Train the ANN using the training script.
Evaluate and visualize the results.
