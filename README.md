## Features  
- Implementation of a fully connected ANN.  
- Supports customizable architectures with multiple layers and activation functions.  
- Includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation scripts.  
- Visualizations for training performance and prediction outcomes.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (or the framework you used)  
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**  

## Applications  
- Predictive modeling for datasets in fields like:  
  - Finance  
  - Healthcare  
  - And more
